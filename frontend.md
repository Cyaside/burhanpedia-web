# Frontend Architecture Overview

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js**: React-based framework for server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing.
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and better developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS / PostCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework and post-processing for styles.

## Frontend Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with UI components (forms, navigation, etc.).
2. **State Management**: Local state is managed using React hooks or context. For global state, libraries like Redux or Zustand can be integrated.
3. **API Requests**: Frontend sends HTTP requests to the backend (NestJS API) using fetch, Axios, or React Query.
4. **Authentication**: Uses Supabase Auth for login/register flows. Tokens are stored securely (e.g., HttpOnly cookies or localStorage).
5. **Data Fetching**: Product, user, and order data are fetched from the backend and displayed in components.
6. **File Uploads**: Product images or files are uploaded directly to Supabase Storage or via backend endpoints.
7. **Routing**: Next.js handles routing between pages (e.g., dashboard, login, register).
8. **UI Rendering**: Components render data and update based on user actions and API responses.

## Connections & Integrations

- **Frontend <-> Backend**: Communicates via REST or GraphQL endpoints exposed by NestJS.
- **Frontend <-> Supabase**: Uses Supabase JS client for authentication, storage, and real-time features.
- **Frontend <-> Next.js**: Next.js manages page routing, SSR, and SSG for better performance and SEO.

## Example Flow: Product Listing

1. User navigates to dashboard page.
2. Frontend fetches product list from backend API.
3. Data is displayed in product components.
4. User can filter, search, or interact with products.

## Notes

- Use environment variables for API and Supabase credentials.
- Ensure proper error handling and loading states in UI.
- For real-time updates, leverage Supabase's real-time features or websockets.
- Optimize images and assets for faster load times.
